# Emerging inverse energy transfer mechanism in coupled helium-4 vortex reconnections

LaTeX code for the paper on superfluid vortex reconnections, in particular focusing on the inverse energy transfer mechanism of the normal fluid as a result of the superfluid vortex reconnection event.


Vortex reconnections play a fundamental role in fluids.
They increase the complexity of flow and develop small-scale motions.
In this work, we report that in superfluids, they can also excite large scales.
We numerically illustrate that during a superfluid vortex reconnection energy 
is injected 
into the thermal (normal) component of helium~II at small length scales, but is transferred nonlinearly  to larger length scales, increasing the integral length scale of the normal
fluid.  
We show that this inverse energy transfer is triggered by the helical imbalance generated 
in the normal fluid flow by
the mutual friction force coupling the superfluid vortices and the normal component. We finally discuss
the relevance of our findings to 
the problem of superfluid turbulence.
