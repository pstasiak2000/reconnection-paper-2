\paragraph*{Introduction.---}

Turbulence is a fundamental phenomenon that governs fluid motion across a vast range of scales, influencing everything from atmospheric dynamics to industrial processes. Understanding turbulence and the mechanisms of energy cascades is crucial for predicting flow behavior, optimizing performance, and advancing technologies in fields such as aerospace engineering, meteorology, and oceanography. In three-dimensional classical fluid dynamics, turbulence is often characterised by a forward cascade - a transfer of an inviscid, conserved quantity (typically energy) from large eddies to increasingly smaller eddies by nonlinear interactions of fluid elements, until dissipation occurs at the smallest length scales \cite{richardson1922weather}. The distribution of energy across length scales in fluid dynamics is often referred to as the Kolmogorov spectrum, where the energy spectrum $E(k)$ scales according to $\sim k^{-5/3}$ at the intermediate length scales \cite{frisch1995}.  
Confining turbulence to two-dimensions is fundamentally different: a dual cascade emerges of both energy and enstrophy. The interplay between the two quanties favours the generation and persistence of large scale coherent structures, resulting in energy transfer from small to large length scales - an inverse cascade. 

Remarkably, fluids that have undergone Bose-Einstein condensation such as helium-4 and atomic condensates differ signifcantly from classical fluids, yet can still capture the same behaviour \cite{maurer1998,baggaley2012,sherwin-robson2015}. In such exotic fluids, quantum mechanics dominates the dynamics, leading to peculiar phenomena such as superfluidity (flow without viscosity) and quantisation of circulation in superfluid vortices \cite{barenghi2009vortices}. Kolmogorov-like scaling laws in helium-4 have been observed experimentally both in mechanically generated turbulence \cite{salort2010turbulent} \red{cite more} and thermally generated turbulence using counterflow channels \cite{gao2017energy} \red{cite more}. Theoretical \cite{bradley2012energy,reeves2013,simula2014emergence} and experimental \cite{johnstone2019evolution,gauthier2019giant} work in quasi-two-dimensional atomic condensates also report the existence of an inverse energy cascade by small scale forcing.

In recent years the role of helicity has been highlighted in the generation of inverse energy transfers for three-dimensional turbulence, without the constraint of quasi-two-dimensionality \cite{chen2003,biferaleInverseEnergyCascade2012a}. Statistically stationary inverse energy transfer has been sustained in a three-dimensional system by an imbalance of non-local homochiral modes through decimating certain triadic interactions \cite{biferaleInverseEnergyCascade2012a}, and more recently by a strong, external injection of positive helical modes at all length scales \cite{plunianInverseCascadeEnergy2020a}. We will show that a chiral imbalance is a naturally occuring phenomenon in superfluids as a result of quantum vortex reconnection events.  During such events, two superfluid vortices collide and exchange circulation, altering the overall topology \cite{villois2020irreversible,zuccher2012quantum}. Punctuated energy injection resulting from the violent nature of vortex reconnections \cite{stasiak2024quantum} pave the way for an imbalance of chirality by multi-scale energy injection. 

In principle, to facilitate an inverse transfer of energy in a classical fluid requires a precise construction of conditions. In this Letter, we aim to show that an inverse energy transfer arises naturally in the normal fluid phase of superfluid helium-4 as a result of superfluid vortex reconnections, an intrinsic property of all superfluids. We will show that energy is injected at the small length scales immediately in the post reconnection regimes and moves towards larger length scales, increasing the integral length scale $\mathcal{L}_E$ of the normal fluid component. We provide an explanation of the inverse energy transfer by decomposing the velocity and mutual friction fields (the governing interaction force between the two-fluid components) into helical modes, showing that the imbalance of homochiral modes resulting from the punctuated energy and helicity injection during the reconnection process. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our findings to the broader field of transitions to superfluid turbulence.

\paragraph*{Main results.---} 

\red{Now that we have decided to write a more fluid dynamics paper, you need to explain better the method as if the reader does not have an idea of what a superlfuid is. If not explicitly the Biot-Savart law, which is well known in fluid dynamics and which can be put in the supplementary, 
the vortex equation of motion is needed. 
}

In this Letter, we use the Schwarz model~\cite{schwarz1988} to evolve vortex filaments $\s(\xi,t)$, where $\xi$ is the natural parametrisation of vortex lines, also known as the arclength. The normal fluid is coupled via the mutual friction force $\mathbf{f}_{ns}$ in a self-consistent manner using a recently developed technique in Ref.~\cite{galantucciNewSelfconsistentApproach2020b}. \red{here you need to specify both the vortex equation of motion and the Navier-Stokes modified equation. As it is a fluid dynamics paper, I would specify that the mutual friction is the line integral of the mutual friction per unit length and write that the regularisation is performed using a physically self-consistent scheme (Casciola's group in Rome). Normally we don't specify it because in the superfluid community this is not really appreciated. Once this is done, then we start with the initial condistions}. We set two pairs of orthogonal vortices, where \red{corresponding} vortices in each pair have \red{oppposite} circulation \red{in order} to preserve superfluid periodicity along the boundaries, and we consider two \red{distinct} temperatures, $T=1.9K$ and $T=2.1K$. Vortex pairs are seperated by distance $D_{\ell}$, and each vortex within each pair is seperated by distance $d_{\ell}$, such that \red{$d_{\ell}\ll D_{\ell}$}. The seperation of scales ensures that the dynamics in the vicinity of the reconnection are dominated by local interactions, and that far-reaching contributions from the other vortex pair are neglible. 

\red{The evolution of the vortex reconnection of a single pair is reported in Fig. \ref{fig:visualisation} }. 

\red{I would move this part on the normal fluid solver before the initial condition description.}

The normal fluid is initally quiescent, and evolves according to a classical Navier-Stokes equation
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial\v_n}{\partial t } + (\v_n\cdot\nabla)\v_n = -\nabla\left(\frac{p}{\rho_n}\right) + \nu_n\nabla^2\v_n + \frac{\mathbf{F}_{ns}}{\rho_n}
\end{equation}
 
where $\v_n$ denotes the normal fluid velocity, $p$ is the pressure, $\rho_n$ is the normal fluid density, $\nu_n$ is the kinematic viscosity and $\mathbf{F}_{ns}$ is the mutual friction coupling, arising from the relative motion between the normal fluid and superfluid vortices 
\red{here I would express $\mathbf{F}_{ns}$ as a linear integral, report its expression and details in the Supplementary, say a few words on its regularisation as pointed out earlier and then continue with saying that $\mathbf{F}_{ns}\propto \left|\v_{l}-\v_n\right|$ }
$\mathbf{F}_{ns}\propto \left|\v_{l}-\v_n\right|$ where $\v_l$ is the velocity of vortex lines. 
\red{I would not include the next sentence, might raise unnecessary questions from the referees. Maybe some details on why the mutual friction exists (scattering of rotons) can be reported in the supplementary.}.The generation of the force is highly localised in space, at microscopic length scales on the order of the vortex core radius $\sim a_0$, and $\Delta x \gg a_0$, where $\Delta x$ is a typical grid discretisation. 

\red{I would remove the part on vorticity as we don't include its spectrum anymore and I would explain more detail the injection mechanism:
reconnection implies cusp which then relaxes in structures with small radii of curvature. As $F_{ns}\propto|\v_l-\v|\approx|\v_l|\propto 1/R_c$, the scale of 
energy injection is small as $R_c$ is small. This can be seen in Figure 2. As time goes by, the friction damps the smallest perturbations, and this is why the injection spectrum moves towards large scales. We also see an inverse transfer of energy, which does not arise entirely because the injection moves towards large scales. In fact if we compute the energy flux ...}

Abrupt changes in the topology of vortex lines, such as during vortex reconnections, form highly curved cusps and strongly inject vorticity (see Fig. \ref{fig:visualisation}), since $|\v_l-\v|\approx|\v_l|\propto\zeta$ in the first approximation, where $\zeta$ is the curvature of vortex lines.

\end{figure}

In this way, energy is injected into the normal fluid at the small length scales in a natural way in the absence of external property, an intrinsic and unique feature of quantum fluids. The injection of energy is clear in the kinetic energy spectrum $E_k$ which is shown in in Fig. \ref{fig:kinetic-energy}, at wavenumbers $k>10$ a vast increase can be observed $E_k(t\approx t_0)/E_k(t\ll t_0)\sim10^2$, evidence of very strong energy injection. Remarkably, in the post reconnection regime $E_k$ appears to increase when $k$ is small, and decay at large values of $k$, suggesting a possible mechanism by which energy generated at small length scales is transferred to larger scales. The energy spectrum $E_k$ evolves according to the balance sources/sinks and internal transfers,
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial E_k}{\partial t} = T_k - D_k + I_k
\end{equation}
where $T_k$ is the spectral kinetic energy transfer function, $D_k=2\nu_n k^2 E_k$ is the dissipation spectrum and $I_k=\mathrm{Re}(\hat{\mathbf{F}}_{ns}(\k)\cdot\hat{\v}^*(\k))$ is the injection spectrum due to the mutual friction $\mathbf{F}_{ns}$. The injection spectrum $I_k$ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:injection-spec} again shows that the injection of energy covers primarily the high $k$ range, but is not limited to a thin band of injection. In fact, the energy flux $\Pi_E(k) = \int_k^{\infty}T_k dk$ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:energy-flux} asserts a hallmark feature of inverse energy cascades, typical in 2D isotropic turbulence. A flux of $\Pi_E(k)<0$ implies a negative flux of energy from small to large $k$, i.e. an inverse transfer of energy. The effect of kinetic energy transferral to large length scales results in the creation of large scale structures, evident in the evolution of the integral length scale $\mathcal{L}_{E}$, where
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_E = \frac{\pi}{2\langle\mathbf{v}'^2\rangle}\int_0^{\infty}\frac{E_k}{k}dk
\end{equation}
and $\langle\mathbf{v}'^2\rangle$ represents the turbulent kinetic energy. In the inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:energy-flux}, $\mathcal{L}_E$ steadily increases in the post-reconnection region, implying a generation of large scale structure.

\end{figure}


In order to explain the inverse energy transfer mechanism, 
\red{we look for a chirality unbalance as a result of the reconnection process. we decompose the force (explain how, as you do in the current version) and we indeed observe that the force is chiral (maybe the force ratio could be poltted in log/log plot?), which results in changing the chirality of the flow as seen in the inset of Figure ...}
we follow recent work in classical fluids outlined in Refs.~\cite{biferaleInverseEnergyCascade2012a,plunianInverseCascadeEnergy2020a}, where it is even possible to sustain an inverse energy cascade under a helical forcing applied at all length scales. Typically, velocity coefficients $\hat{\v}(\k)$ can be decomposed into their helical modes, where $\hat{\v}(\k)=v^+(\k)\h^+(\k) + v^-(\k)\h^-(\k)$ and satisfies $\k\cdot\hat{\v}(\k)=0$, where $\v^{\pm}$ are complex scalars and $\h^{\pm}(\k)$ are the two eigenvectors of the curl operator, such that $i\k\times\h^{\pm}(\k)=\pm k \h^{\pm}(\k)$. To explain the inverse energy transfer in terms of helical modes, we show that in fact the driving force, which in our case is a punctuated burst due to superfluid vortex reconnections, is of a helical nature. The mutual friction modes $\hat{\mathbf{F}}_{ns}(\k)$ are not incompressible, and so we take the projection of the modes orthogonal to the wavenumber $\k$,
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\k) = \hat{\mathbf{F}}_{ns}(\k) - \frac{(\hat{\mathbf{F}}_{ns}(\k)\cdot\k)}{k^2}\k.
\end{equation}
The projected modes $\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\k)$ are then decomposed into helical modes $\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\k)=f^+\h^{+}(\k) + f^-\h^{-}(\k)$. The ratio of the two helical modes $|f^+|^2/|f^-|^2$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mutual-friction-decomp}. At reconnection time $t_0$, the ratio is much larger, indicating a clear inbalance that favours the injection of positive helical modes. In the same way, helicity modes $\hat{\mathcal{H}}(\k)$ can be decomposed,
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\mathcal{H}}(\k) = k(E^+(\k) - E^-(\k)) = \mathcal{H}^+ + \mathcal{H}^-
\end{equation}
where $E^{\pm}=\frac{1}{2}|\v^{\pm}(\k)|^2$ are the helical energy modes. The evolution of the ratio $\mathcal{H}^+/\mathcal{H}^-$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:helicity-modes}. The sharp increase at reconnection time $t_0$ is evidence of a large influx of positive helical modes as a result of the vortex reconnection, which is in agreement with the conditions to facilitate an inverse energy transfer by a helical injection. Finally, as observed in Ref.~\cite{plunianInverseCascadeEnergy2020a}, it is necessary for the forcing to cover the entire spectrum of $k$, which from Fig.~\ref{fig:injection-spec}, it is evident that this indeed the case.
