\begin{abstract}
We numerically show that during a superfluid vortex reconnection energy is injected 
into the thermal (normal) component of helium~II at small length scales, but is transferred nonlinearly  to larger length scales, increasing the integral length scale of the normal
fluid.  We provide an explanation of this inverse energy transfer by decomposing the velocity and 
the mutual friction (which couples superfluid and normal fluid) into helical modes, showing 
that the imbalance of homochiral modes results from the punctuated energy and helicity 
injection during the reconnection. Crucially, the
chiral imbalance occurs spontaneously from reconnections, unlike ordinary Navier-Stokes turbulence
where careful external control is required. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our findings to 
the problem of superfluid turbulence.

%\paragraph*{Introduction.---} 
Turbulence is ubiquitous in the universe.  It occurs in systems
as large as nebulae of interstellar gas, and as small as clouds of
few thousands atoms confined by lasers in the laboratory.
Turbulence shapes patterns and properties of fluids of all
kinds, from ordinary
 viscous fluids (Navier-Stokes turbulence\cite{frisch1995}) 
to electrically conducting fluids (magneto-hydrodynamics turbulence
\cite{canuto-dalsgaard-1998}) to quantum fluid
(quantum turbulence \cite{barenghi-etal-2023,
Barenghi_Skrbek_Sreenivasan_2023}).
All turbulent systems are characterised by 
the existence of a wide range 
of length scales across which inviscid conserved quantities 
are transferred without loss in the spirit of the cascade 
depicted by Richardson \cite{richardson1922weather}. 

In three-dimensional classical fluids, turbulence 
is characterised by a direct cascade: the
non-linear dissipationless transfer of kinetic energy from the scale of
the large eddies (at which energy is injected) to the smallest length scales
at which energy is dissipated into heat
\cite{richardson1922weather,kolmogorov-1941}. 
The resulting distribution of energy across length scales is
the celebrated Kolmogorov energy spectrum 
\cite{kolmogorov-1941,frisch1995}. 

Confining Navier-Stokes turbulence to two-dimensions entails 
fundamentally distinct physics: a dual cascade emerges of energy and enstrophy 
(mean squared vorticity) \cite{kraichnan-1967,boffetta-ecke-2012}, 
the two conserved quantities in ideal two-dimensional flows.
% \red{(in
%three dimensions the conserved quantities are energy and helicity)}. 
In particular, while the enstrophy cascade is direct (from large to small
scales), the energy cascade is inverse (from small to large scales)
\cite{boffetta-musacchio-2010}. This inverse cascade 
may favour the generation and persistence of large coherent 
structures \cite{laurie-etal-2014}. 

Remarkably, the same cascade phenomenology is observed in turbulent flows 
of quantum fluids, {\textit{i.e.} fluids at very low temperatures whose physics is
dominated by quantum effects.
Examples of such fluids are superfluid helium 
and atomic Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). 
The dynamics of these systems can be successfully depicted in terms of 
a two-fluid model \cite{tisza-1938,landau-1949,skrbek-sreenivasan-2012} 
describing the quantum fluid as the mixture of two components, 
the superfluid component and the thermal (or normal) component, which 
interact by means of a mutual friction force 
\cite{jackson-etal-2009,hall-vinen-1956a,hall-vinen-1956b}. 
The superfluid component flows without viscosity and
vanishing entropy; its vorticity is
confined to effectively one-dimensional vortex filaments
of atomic core thickness (called quantum vortices or vortex lines), 
around which the circulation of the velocity is quantised.
In BECs the thermal component forms a ballistic gas,
whereas in superfluid $^4$He it can be described as
a classical viscous fluid.
Despite these significant differences with respect to ordinary fluids, 
the forward kinetic energy cascade has
indeed been observed in three-dimensional superfluid
turbulence 
\cite{maurer1998,salort2010turbulent,baggaley2012,sherwin-robson2015,Muller_KolmogorovKelvinWave_2020,Muller_IntermittencyVelocityCirculation_2021}.
Evidence of this forward cascade has been found also in
three-dimensional turbulent BECs \cite{middleton-spencer2022,Zhu_DirectInverseCascades_2023}. Similarly to 2D classical turbulence, 
an inverse energy cascade characterises two-dimensional BECs, 
as shown in theoretical \cite{bradley2012energy,reeves2013,simula2014emergence,Muller_ExploringEquivalenceTwoDimensional_2024} and experimental \cite{johnstone2019evolution,gauthier2019giant} studies.

In turbulent systems, the type and the number of sign-defined ideal invariants determine the direction of cascades. Indeed, the famous and simple Fjørtoft argument \cite{fjortoft1953changes} predicts in 2D classical turbulence the existence of an inverse energy cascade. Similarly, for 3D wave-turbulent 3D BECs, the Fjørtoft argument predicts an inverse particle and a direct energy cascades. In 3D classical fluids, helicity is not sign-defined and thus only a direct energy cascade is possible. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the direction of the energy 
cascade may be inverted by artificially controlling the chirality of the 
flow, \textit{i.e.} the balance between positive or negative helical modes \cite{moffatt1969}, eventually making helicity almost a sign defined quantity. Indeed, by restricting the non-linear energy transfer to homochiral interactions via a suitable decimation of the Navier-Stokes equation 
\cite{biferaleInverseEnergyCascade2012a,biferale-etal-2013}, controlling the weight of homochiral interactions \cite{sahoo-etal-2017} or the external injection 
of positive helical modes at all length scales \cite{plunianInverseCascadeEnergy2020a}, inverse energy cascades have been observed in three-dimensional turbulence of classical fluids. In brief, when the flow is synthetically designed to have an enhanced chirality, an inverse energy cascade can observed.


In this work, we unveil a similar dynamics occurring in superfluid helium
($^4$He) as a result of vortex reconnections.  
Reconnections occur continuously in turbulence: they occur when
two vortex lines collide and recombine, exchanging heads and tails, 
altering the overall topology of the flow
\cite{koplik-levine-1993,bewley-etal-2008,rorai-etal-2016,serafini-etal-2017,galantucci-baggaley-parker-barenghi-2019,villoisUniversalNonuniversalAspects2017,villois2020irreversible}. 
Indeed, we show that the mutual friction force arising from the  
vortex reconnection is chiral, injecting in the normal fluid prevalently 
helicity of a given sign. Thus, as a consequence of vortex reconnections,
we observe an increase of the chiral imbalance of the quantum fluid, producing a transfer of kinetic energy from small to large scales, similarly to the 
phenomenology observed in 3D helical-decimated classical flows. 
Importantly, this chiral imbalance arises naturally as physical process in the normal fluid as a result of vortex reconnections. This is contrast to classical fluid dynamics,  where the helical characteristics of the flows producing 
an inverse energy transfer require a careful synthetic construction 
\cite{biferaleInverseEnergyCascade2012a,biferale-etal-2013,sahoo-etal-2017,plunianInverseCascadeEnergy2020a}.

% WE ADD REFERENCE TO OUR FIRST PAPER LATER IN THE TEXT
%Punctuated energy injection resulting from the violent nature of vortex reconnections \cite{stasiak2024quantum} pave the way for an imbalance of chirality by multi-scale energy injection.
%

%% THIS PART IS TOO DETAILED OF WHAT WE WILL DO AT THIS STAGE, ALTHOUGH PART OF IT MIGHT BE USED IN THE ABSTRACT
%We will show that energy is injected at the small length scales immediately in the post reconnection regimes and moves towards larger length scales, increasing the integral length scale $\mathcal{L}_E$ of the normal fluid component. We provide an explanation of the inverse energy transfer by decomposing the velocity and mutual friction fields (the governing interaction force between the two-fluid components) into helical modes, showing that the imbalance of homochiral modes resulting from the punctuated energy and helicity injection during the reconnection process. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our findings to the broader field of transitions to superfluid turbulence.

To model superfluid helium dynamics, we employ the recently developed FOUCAULT model
\cite{galantucciNewSelfconsistentApproach2020b}.  In this approach, superfluid vortex lines are
parametrized as one-dimensional space curves  $\s(\xi,t)$, $\xi$ and $t$ being arclength and time respectively, exploiting the large separation of length scales between the vortex core radius, the Lagrangian discretisation along the vortex lines $\Delta\xi$, and the average radius of curvature $R_c$ of the vortex lines. The vortex lines evolve according to the following equation of motion:
\begin{equation}
    \dot{\s}(\xi,t) = \v_s + \frac{\beta}{1+\beta}\left[\v_{ns}\cdot\s'\right]\s' + \beta\s'\times\v_{ns} + \beta'\s'\times\left[\s'\times\v_{ns}\right],
\end{equation}
where $\dot{\s} = \partial\s/\partial t$, $\s' = \partial\s/\partial\xi$ is the unit tangent vector, $\v_n$ and $\v_s$ are the normal fluid and superfluid velocities at $\s$, $\v_{ns} = \v_n-\v_s$, and $\beta,\, \beta'$ are temperature and Reynolds number dependent mutual friction coefficients \cite{galantucciNewSelfconsistentApproach2020b}. The calculation of the superfluid velocity $\v_s$ is performed via the computation of the Biot-Savart integral de-singularised with standard techniques (see Supplementary Material \cite{suppMat}). The normal fluid is described classically using the incompressible ($\nabla\cdot\v_n=0$) 
Navier-Stokes equation
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial\v_n}{\partial t} + (\v_n\cdot\nabla)\v_n = -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p  + \nu_n\nabla^2\v_n + \frac{\mathbf{F}_{ns}}{\rho_n} \; \; , 
\end{equation}

\noindent
where 
$\rho_n$ and $\rho_s$ are the normal fluid and superfluid densities,
$\rho=\rho_n + \rho_s$,  $p$ is the pressure,  $\nu_n$ is the kinematic 
viscosity of the normal fluid, and the mutual friction force per unit
volume, $\mathbf{F}_{ns}$, is the line integral of the mutual friction 
force per unit length, $\mathbf{f}_{ns}$ \cite{suppMat}:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}_{ns}(\x) = 
\oint_{\mathcal{T}}\delta(\x-\s)\mathbf{f}_{ns}(\s)d\xi,     
\end{equation}
$\mathcal{T}$ representing the entire vortex configuration. 
The regularisation of mutual friction is performed using a physically self-consistent scheme \cite{galantucciNewSelfconsistentApproach2020b, gualtieri2015exact, gualtieri2017turbulence}.

To study the reconnection dynamics, we consider
two pairs of initially orthogonal vortices 
(where the corresponding vortices of each pair have opposite circulation 
in order to preserve periodicity along the boundaries)
at two temperatures, $T=1.9K$ and $T=2.1K$. The vortex pairs are 
separated by the distance $D_{\ell}$; each vortex within each pair is 
initially at distance $d_{\ell}$ to the other vortex, 
such that $d_{\ell}\ll D_{\ell}$ to ensures that the dynamics 
in the vicinity of the reconnection is dominated by local interactions, 
and that the far-field contribution from the other vortex pair is
neglible. \NOTE{GK: add a very short description of numerical parameters.} The evolution of the vortex reconnection of a single pair is reported in Fig. \ref{fig:visualisation}.

\end{figure}

We first focus the attention on the time evolution of the normal fluid energy spectrum $E(k)$ (where $k$ is the magnitude of the three-dimensional wavenumber), illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:kinetic-energy}. It clearly emerges that, during the reconnection, energy is predominantly injected into the normal fluid at intermediate and small length scales. 
For $k>5$ in correspondence of the reconnection time $t_0$,
we observe a significant increase of the normal fluid energy spectral density:
$E(k,\, t\approx t_0)/E(k,\, t\ll t_0) \approx 10^2$. 

In the post-reconnection regime, we simultaneously observe a small 
decrease of the spectrum at intermediate 
and small scales ($k > 5$) and an increase at large scales, 
suggesting the existence of a mechanism by 
which energy generated at small length scales is transferred to larger scales. 
To shed light on this mechanism
we analyse the dynamics of the normal fluid flow using the 
spectral energy budget equation: 

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial E(k)}{\partial t} = T(k) - D(k) + I(k)
\end{equation}
where $T(k)$ is the spectral kinetic energy transfer function,
%(\textit{i.e.} $T(k)dk$ is the energy transfered per unit time by modes with $k < |\mathbf{k}| < k +dk$, determined by non-linear effects), 
$D(k)=2\nu_n k^2 E_k$ is the dissipation spectrum and
%=\mathrm{Re}(\hat{\mathbf{F}}_{ns}(\k)\cdot\hat{\v}^*(\k))$ 
$I(k)$ is the injection spectrum arising from the mutual friction 
force $\mathbf{F}_{ns}$. 
Immediately after the reconnection, each vortex has the shape of
a sharp cusp (corresponding to a small radius of curvature $R_c$)
which immediately starts relaxing ($R_c$ increases). Since
$|\mathbf{F}_{ns}| \propto  |\dot{\s}-\v_n| \approx |\dot{\s}| \propto 1/R_c$, 
the scales of energy injection at reconnection are necessarily
much smaller than the original length scales before the reconnection, 
as it can be observed in the inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:kinetic-energy}. 
As time evolves, the smallest perturbations on the vortex lines are damped 
by friction the fastest, resulting in the shift of 
the peak of the injection spectrum $I(k)$ towards larger length scales. 
However this shift does not account 
for the increase of $E(k)$ at the largest scales after reconnection, 
which arises from non-linear effects.
Indeed, if we compute the energy flux 
$\displaystyle \Pi(k) = \int_{k}^{\infty}T(k') dk'$ 
(reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:energy-flux} at different times and temperatures), 
we observe that $\Pi(k) < 0$ for all $k$ during and after reconnection;
we also observe that, near the time of reconnection,
the peak value of $|\Pi(k)|$ is in the range $5 < k < 15$.
The negative sign of $\Pi(k)$ is evidence of a flux of kinetic 
energy from small to large scales. In other words, at non-zero temperatures,
vortex reconnections trigger an inverse transfer of energy, 
which implies the creation of large scale structures, visible
in Fig.~\ref{fig:visualisation}} 
This effect is quantified by
the evolution of the integral length scale $\mathcal{L}$, 
defined as \NOTE{GK: coud we change $\mathcal{L}\to L_0$?}
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = \frac{\pi}{2 K}\int_0^{\infty}\frac{E(k)}{k}dk
\end{equation}
where $K=\int_0^{\infty}\!\!E(k)dk$ is the total turbulent kinetic
energy. The inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:energy-flux} shows that
$\mathcal{L}$ steadily increases in the post-reconnection regime,
implying generation of large scale structures. 

\begin{figure}[b]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=0.48\textwidth]{fmfDecompFig.pdf}
    \caption{The ratio of the projected helical mutual friction modes $f^+(k)$ and $f^-(k)$
at different times and temperatures as in Fig.~\ref{fig:kinetic-energy} \NOTE{GK: lengthscale for $\kappa (t-t_0)$} ?}.
    \label{fig:mutual-friction-decomp}
\end{figure}

To explain the inverse energy transfer shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:kinetic-energy},
we look whether the reconnection triggers a chirality imbalance. 
We decompose the incompressible Fourier modes of the normal fluid velocity 
into helical modes \cite{waleffe-1992}:

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{v}}_n (\k) = \hat{\mathbf{v}}_n^+(\k) +\hat{\mathbf{v}}_n^-(\k)=
 v_n^+(\mathbf{k}) \mathbf{h}^+(\mathbf{k})+v_n^-(\mathbf{k}) \mathbf{h}^-(\mathbf{k}),
\end{equation}

\noindent 
where $\mathbf{h}^\pm (\mathbf{k})$ are the two eigenvectors of the curl 
operator, \textit{i.e.} $i\k~\times~\h^{\pm}(\k)~=~\pm k \h^{\pm}(\k)$. 
Similarly, we decompose the Fourier of the transverse mutual friction force:
$\hat{\mathbf{F}}_{ns}^{\perp} = f^+ \mathbf{h}^+ + f^- \mathbf{h}^-$
(the  Fourier modes of $\mathbf{F}_{ns}$ parallel to the wavemumber 
$\k$ do not play any role in the time evolution of $\mathbf{v}_n$ 
due to the incompressible constraint). 
The spectral energy densities corresponding to the helical modes are
$E^{\pm}(\k) = (1/2) |v_n^\pm(\k)|^2$, the total spectral density 
being $E(\k) = E^{+}(\k) + E^{-}(\k)$. Similarly the spectral helicity 
density is 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
H(\k) & = (1/2) \hat{\mathbf{v}}_n (\k)\!\!\! ~\cdot~\!\!\! \hat{\bm{\omega}}_n^* (\k) = \\
& = k E^+(\k) - k E^-(\k)  = H^+(\k) - H^-(\k),
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent 
where $\bm{\omega}_n$ is the normal fluid vorticity, the star indicates 
complex conjugate and $H^\pm$ is the helicity contribution of each 
separate helical mode. 
The rate of change $I^\pm(\k)$ of the energies $E^{\pm}(\k)$ arising from the mutual 
friction is proportional to the corresponding helical coefficients
$f^\pm$, \textit{i.e.} $I^\pm(\k) = \mathrm{Re} [f^\pm (v_n^\pm)^*] /\rho_n$, 
and the related signed helicity injection is 
$I_H^\pm(\k) = k \mathrm{Re} [f^\pm (v_n^\pm)^*] /\rho_n$. 

A chiral imbalance occurs if the mutual friction force is helical, 
\textit{i.e.} if the ratio $|f^+|^2/|f^-|^2 \neq 1$. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:mutual-friction-decomp}, we show the spectra of $|f^+|^2/|f^-|^2$, 
before, during and after the reconnection for both temperatures. It is apparent
that during and after the reconnection, the mutual friction force is chiral,
injecting more positive helicity than negative helicity. 
As a result, the ratio $\mathcal{H}^+/\mathcal{H}^-$ 
(reported in the inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:mutual-friction-decomp}), 
where $\mathcal{H}^\pm (t) = \int\!\!H^\pm(\k,t)d\k$), 
increases significantly at reconnection and remains larger than unity even at later times, 
indicating that the flow is chiral. We conclude that the reconnection triggers indeed
a chiral imbalance.
%Furthermore, as observed in
%Ref.~\cite{plunianInverseCascadeEnergy2020a}, to observe a negative energy flux the forcing needs to cover the entire spectrum of $k$, which  from the inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:kinetic-energy}, it is evident that this indeed the case.


  

%we follow recent work in classical fluids outlined in Refs.~\cite{biferaleInverseEnergyCascade2012a,plunianInverseCascadeEnergy2020a}, where it is even possible to sustain an inverse energy cascade under a helical forcing applied at all length scales. Typically, velocity coefficients $\hat{\v}(\k)$ can be decomposed into their helical modes, where $\hat{\v}(\k)=v^+(\k)\h^+(\k) + v^-(\k)\h^-(\k)$ and satisfies $\k\cdot\hat{\v}(\k)=0$, where $\v^{\pm}$ are complex scalars and $\h^{\pm}(\k)$ are the two eigenvectors of the curl operator, such that $i\k\times\h^{\pm}(\k)=\pm k \h^{\pm}(\k)$. To explain the inverse energy transfer in terms of helical modes, we show that in fact the driving force, which in our case is a punctuated burst due to superfluid vortex reconnections, is of a helical nature. The mutual friction modes $\hat{\mathbf{F}}_{ns}(\k)$ are not incompressible, and so we take the projection of the modes orthogonal to the wavenumber $\k$. The projected modes $\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\k)$ are then decomposed into helical modes $\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\k)=f^+\h^{+}(\k) + f^-\h^{-}(\k)$. The ratio of the two helical modes $|f^+|^2/|f^-|^2$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mutual-friction-decomp}. At reconnection time $t_0$, the ratio is much larger, indicating that indeed this force is chiral and that a clear inbalance that favours the injection of positive helical modes, changing the chirality of the flow (as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:mutual-friction-decomp}). In the same way, helicity modes $\hat{\mathcal{H}}(\k)$ can be decomposed,
%\begin{equation}
%    \hat{\mathcal{H}}(\k) = k(E^+(\k) - E^-(\k)) = \mathcal{H}^+ + \mathcal{H}^-
%\end{equation}
%where $E^{\pm}=\frac{1}{2}|\v^{\pm}(\k)|^2$ are the helical energy modes. The evolution of the ratio $\mathcal{H}^+/\mathcal{H}^-$ is shown in the inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:mutual-friction-decomp}. The sharp increase at reconnection time $t_0$ is evidence of a large influx of positive helical modes as a result of the vortex reconnection, which is in agreement with the conditions to facilitate an inverse energy transfer by a helical injection. Finally, as observed in Ref.~\cite{plunianInverseCascadeEnergy2020a}, it is necessary for the forcing to cover the entire spectrum of $k$, which from the inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:kinetic-energy}, it is evident that this indeed the case.           

%\paragraph*{Closing remarks.---}
In conclusion, the reconnection of quantum vortices in the two-fluid regime
($T\gtrsim 1.5$K) not only injects punctuated
energy in the normal fluid \cite{stasiak2024quantum}, but also triggers in the normal fluid
a transfer of kinetic energy towards the large scales. This inverse 
energy transfer arises from the fact that the mutual friction force (injecting energy and 
helicity in the normal fluid) is helical, as Kelvin waves develop on the vortices.
The helical character of the mutual friction produces a chiral imbalance in the normal fluid, driving this inverse cascade as previously observed in turbulent Navier-Stokes flows
\cite{biferaleInverseEnergyCascade2012a,plunianInverseCascadeEnergy2020a}.
Our findings have profound implications for the nature of finite temperature superfluid turbulence and motivate a detailed studied of fully coupled quantum turbulence to understand how energy transfer and dissipation is augmented by vortex reconnections.
