Our study reveals that in superfluids, vortex reconnection trigger an inverse energy transfer unlike
classical vortex reconnections. The underlying mechanism is 'classical', namely the generation of
a helical imbalance in the normal fluid embedding superfluid vortices. 
Our paper hence contributes to the lively debate comparing classical and quantum turbulence, introducing
an element which until now has been significantly overlooked: the role of helicity, its generation, dissipation
and transfer between the two fluid components constituting superfluids. We believe that our findings will stimulate
further studies in this direction.
