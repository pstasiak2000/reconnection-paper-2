  abstract = {Abstract             We present the Fully cOUpled loCAl model of sUperfLuid Turbulence (FOUCAULT) that describes the dynamics of finite temperature superfluids. The superfluid component is described by the vortex filament method while the normal fluid is governed by a modified Navier--Stokes equation. The superfluid vortex lines and normal fluid components are fully coupled in a self-consistent manner by the friction force, which induces local disturbances in the normal fluid in the vicinity of vortex lines. The main focus of this work is the numerical scheme for distributing the friction force to the mesh points where the normal fluid is defined (stemming from recent advances in the study of the interaction between a classical viscous fluid and small active particles) and for evaluating the velocity of the normal fluid on the Lagrangian discretisation points along the vortex lines. In particular, we show that if this numerical scheme is not careful enough, spurious results may occur. The new scheme which we propose to overcome these difficulties is based on physical principles. Finally, we apply the new method to the problem of the motion of a superfluid vortex ring in a stationary normal fluid and in a turbulent normal fluid.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear interactions in homogeneous turbulence are investigated using a decomposition of the velocity field in terms of helical modes. There are two helical modes per wave vector and thus eight fundamental triad interactions. These eight elementary interactions fit in only two classes, ``R'' (for ``reverse'') and ``F'' (for ``forward''), depending on whether the small-scale helical modes have helicities of the same or of the opposite sign. In a single-triad interaction, the large scale is unstable when the small-scale helical modes have helicities of opposite signs (class ``F''), and the medium scale is unstable otherwise (class ``R''). It is proposed that, on average, the triple correlations in a turbulent flow correspond to these unstable states. In the limit of nonlocal triads, where one leg is much smaller than the other two, the triadic interscale energy transfer is largest for interactions of class ``R.'' In that case, most of the energy flows locally in wave number, from the medium scale to the smallest, with a comparatively small feedback on the large scale. However, integrating over all scales in an inertial range, the net effect of nonlocal interactions of class ``R'' is a reverse\hphantom{,}energy\hphantom{,}cascade from small to large scales. All other interactions transfer energy upward in wave number. In local triads, this upward energy transfer occurs primarily between modes with helicities of the same sign, through catalytic interactions with a mode whose helicity has the opposite sign. The class ``F'' interactions transfer energy to the small scales and exist only in three dimensions. The physical processes associated to both classes of interactions are discussed. It is shown that the large local transfers due to nonlocal ``R'' interactions appear in pairs of opposite signs that nearly cancel each other and the net effect corresponds to an advection in wave space.},

  abstract = {We study the statistical properties of homogeneous and isotropic three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows. By introducing a novel way to make numerical investigations of Navier-Stokes equations, we show that all 3D flows in nature possess a subset of nonlinear evolution leading to a reverse energy transfer: from small to large scales. Up to now, such an inverse cascade was only observed in flows under strong rotation and in quasi-two-dimensional geometries under strong confinement. We show here that energy flux is always reversed when mirror symmetry is broken, leading to a distribution of helicity in the system with a well-defined sign at all wave numbers. Our findings broaden the range of flows where the inverse energy cascade may be detected and rationalize the role played by helicity in the energy transfer process, showing that both 2D and 3D properties naturally coexist in all flows in nature. The unconventional numerical methodology here proposed, based on a Galerkin decimation of helical Fourier modes, paves the road for future studies on the influence of helicity on small-scale intermittency and the nature of the nonlinear interaction in magnetohydrodynamics.},

In contrast to previous studies using decimated triads, our simulations contain all possible triads. By~computing the shell-to-shell energy fluxes, we show that the inverse energy cascade results from weakly non-local interactions among homochiral triads. Varying the helicity injection range of scales leads to necessary conditions to obtain an inverse energy cascade.},

  abstract = {The motion of N point vortices in a two-dimensional fluid is a Hamiltonian dynamical system with a 2N-dimensional phase space. The equations of motion for point vortices in a two-dimensional square doubly periodic domain are derived from those for an open domain. The Hamiltonian has three known constants of the motion and is thus believed to be nonintegrable for four or more vortices. Trajectories are numerically integrated from several initial conditions containing six vortices with varying total energy. Ergodicity on the surface defined by the constants of the motion is directly tested by comparing time-average and ensemble-average vortex pair statistics. It is found that the dynamics is not ergodic. There is evidence that the nonergodicity is not due to a gross fragmentation of phase space as might result from a broken symmetry. Vortex pair statistics are also used to test the randomness of the chaotic motion. It is found that the time-averaged statistics of the vortices are clearly distinct from those of independent random walkers.},
