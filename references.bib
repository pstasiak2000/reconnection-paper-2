  abstract = {Abstract             We present the Fully cOUpled loCAl model of sUperfLuid Turbulence (FOUCAULT) that describes the dynamics of finite temperature superfluids. The superfluid component is described by the vortex filament method while the normal fluid is governed by a modified Navier--Stokes equation. The superfluid vortex lines and normal fluid components are fully coupled in a self-consistent manner by the friction force, which induces local disturbances in the normal fluid in the vicinity of vortex lines. The main focus of this work is the numerical scheme for distributing the friction force to the mesh points where the normal fluid is defined (stemming from recent advances in the study of the interaction between a classical viscous fluid and small active particles) and for evaluating the velocity of the normal fluid on the Lagrangian discretisation points along the vortex lines. In particular, we show that if this numerical scheme is not careful enough, spurious results may occur. The new scheme which we propose to overcome these difficulties is based on physical principles. Finally, we apply the new method to the problem of the motion of a superfluid vortex ring in a stationary normal fluid and in a turbulent normal fluid.},

  abstract = {The reciprocal energy and enstrophy transfers between normal fluid and superfluid components dictate the overall dynamics of superfluid 4He including the generation, evolution and coupling of coherent structures, the distribution of energy among lengthscales, and the decay of turbulence. To better understand the essential ingredients of this interaction, we employ a numerical two-way model which self-consistently accounts for the back-reaction of the superfluid vortex lines onto the normal fluid. Here we focus on a prototypical laminar (non-turbulent) vortex configuration which is simple enough to clearly relate the geometry of the vortex line to energy injection and dissipation to/from the normal fluid: a Kelvin wave excitation on two vortex anti-vortex pairs evolving in (a) an initially quiescent normal fluid, and (b) an imposed counterflow. In (a), the superfluid injects energy and vorticity in the normal fluid. In (b), the superfluid gains energy from the normal fluid via the Donnelly--Glaberson instability.},

  abstract = {We statistically study vortex reconnections in quantum fluids by evolving different realizations of vortex Hopf links using the Gross--Pitaevskii model. Despite the time reversibility of the model, we report clear evidence that the dynamics of the reconnection process is time irreversible, as reconnecting vortices tend to separate faster than they approach. Thanks to a matching theory devised concurrently by Proment and Krstulovic [Phys. Rev. Fluids 5, 104701 (2020)], we quantitatively relate the origin of this asymmetry to the generation of a sound pulse after the reconnection event. Our results have the prospect of being tested in several quantum fluid experiments and, theoretically, may shed new light on the energy transfer mechanisms in both classical and quantum turbulent fluids.},
