  abstract = {The reciprocal energy and enstrophy transfers between normal fluid and superfluid components dictate the overall dynamics of superfluid 4He including the generation, evolution and coupling of coherent structures, the distribution of energy among lengthscales, and the decay of turbulence. To better understand the essential ingredients of this interaction, we employ a numerical two-way model which self-consistently accounts for the back-reaction of the superfluid vortex lines onto the normal fluid. Here we focus on a prototypical laminar (non-turbulent) vortex configuration which is simple enough to clearly relate the geometry of the vortex line to energy injection and dissipation to/from the normal fluid: a Kelvin wave excitation on two vortex anti-vortex pairs evolving in (a) an initially quiescent normal fluid, and (b) an imposed counterflow. In (a), the superfluid injects energy and vorticity in the normal fluid. In (b), the superfluid gains energy from the normal fluid via the Donnelly--Glaberson instability.},

  abstract = {We statistically study vortex reconnections in quantum fluids by evolving different realizations of vortex Hopf links using the Gross--Pitaevskii model. Despite the time reversibility of the model, we report clear evidence that the dynamics of the reconnection process is time irreversible, as reconnecting vortices tend to separate faster than they approach. Thanks to a matching theory devised concurrently by Proment and Krstulovic [Phys. Rev. Fluids 5, 104701 (2020)], we quantitatively relate the origin of this asymmetry to the generation of a sound pulse after the reconnection event. Our results have the prospect of being tested in several quantum fluid experiments and, theoretically, may shed new light on the energy transfer mechanisms in both classical and quantum turbulent fluids.},

The superfluid component is described by the vortex filament method while the normal fluid is governed by a modified Navier--Stokes equation. The superfluid vortex lines and normal fluid components are fully coupled in a self-consistent manner by the friction force, which induces local disturbances in the normal fluid in the vicinity of vortex lines. The main focus of this work is the numerical scheme for distributing the friction force to the mesh points where the normal fluid is defined (stemming from recent advances in the study of the interaction between a classical viscous fluid and small active particles) and for evaluating the velocity of the normal fluid on the Lagrangian discretisation points along the vortex lines. In particular, we show that if this numerical scheme is not careful enough, spurious results may occur. The new scheme which we propose to overcome these difficulties is based on physical principles. Finally, we apply the new method to the problem of the motion of a superfluid vortex ring in a stationary normal fluid and in a turbulent normal fluid.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear interactions in homogeneous turbulence are investigated using a decomposition of the velocity field in terms of helical modes. There are two helical modes per wave vector and thus eight fundamental triad interactions. These eight elementary interactions fit in only two classes, ``R'' (for ``reverse'') and ``F'' (for ``forward''), depending on whether the small-scale helical modes have helicities of the same or of the opposite sign. In a single-triad interaction, the large scale is unstable when the small-scale helical modes have helicities of opposite signs (class ``F''), and the medium scale is unstable otherwise (class ``R''). It is proposed that, on average, the triple correlations in a turbulent flow correspond to these unstable states. In the limit of nonlocal triads, where one leg is much smaller than the other two, the triadic interscale energy transfer is largest for interactions of class ``R.'' In that case, most of the energy flows locally in wave number, from the medium scale to the smallest, with a comparatively small feedback on the large scale. However, integrating over all scales in an inertial range, the net effect of nonlocal interactions of class ``R'' is a reverse\hphantom{,}energy\hphantom{,}cascade from small to large scales. All other interactions transfer energy upward in wave number. In local triads, this upward energy transfer occurs primarily between modes with helicities of the same sign, through catalytic interactions with a mode whose helicity has the opposite sign. The class ``F'' interactions transfer energy to the small scales and exist only in three dimensions. The physical processes associated to both classes of interactions are discussed. It is shown that the large local transfers due to nonlocal ``R'' interactions appear in pairs of opposite signs that nearly cancel each other and the net effect corresponds to an advection in wave space.},

Universal aspects of the reconnection process are investigated by considering different initial vortex configurations and making use of a recently developed tracking algorithm to reconstruct the vortex filaments. We show that during a reconnection event the vortex lines approach and separate always according to the time scaling {$\delta\sim$}t1/2 with prefactors that depend on the vortex configuration. We also investigate the behavior of curvature and torsion close to the reconnection point, demonstrating analytically that the curvature can exhibit a self-similar behavior that might be broken by the development of shocklike structures in the torsion.},

By introducing a novel way to make numerical investigations of Navier-Stokes equations, we show that all 3D flows in nature possess a subset of nonlinear evolution leading to a reverse energy transfer: from small to large scales. Up to now, such an inverse cascade was only observed in flows under strong rotation and in quasi-two-dimensional geometries under strong confinement. We show here that energy flux is always reversed when mirror symmetry is broken, leading to a distribution of helicity in the system with a well-defined sign at all wave numbers. Our findings broaden the range of flows where the inverse energy cascade may be detected and rationalize the role played by helicity in the energy transfer process, showing that both 2D and 3D properties naturally coexist in all flows in nature. The unconventional numerical methodology here proposed, based on a Galerkin decimation of helical Fourier modes, paves the road for future studies on the influence of helicity on small-scale intermittency and the nature of the nonlinear interaction in magnetohydrodynamics.},
