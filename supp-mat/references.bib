  abstract = {The reciprocal energy and enstrophy transfers between normal fluid and superfluid components dictate the overall dynamics of superfluid 4He including the generation, evolution and coupling of coherent structures, the distribution of energy among lengthscales, and the decay of turbulence. To better understand the essential ingredients of this interaction, we employ a numerical two-way model which self-consistently accounts for the back-reaction of the superfluid vortex lines onto the normal fluid. Here we focus on a prototypical laminar (non-turbulent) vortex configuration which is simple enough to clearly relate the geometry of the vortex line to energy injection and dissipation to/from the normal fluid: a Kelvin wave excitation on two vortex anti-vortex pairs evolving in (a) an initially quiescent normal fluid, and (b) an imposed counterflow. In (a), the superfluid injects energy and vorticity in the normal fluid. In (b), the superfluid gains energy from the normal fluid via the Donnelly--Glaberson instability.},

Despite the time reversibility of the model, we report clear evidence that the dynamics of the reconnection process is time irreversible, as reconnecting vortices tend to separate faster than they approach. Thanks to a matching theory devised concurrently by Proment and Krstulovic [Phys. Rev. Fluids 5, 104701 (2020)], we quantitatively relate the origin of this asymmetry to the generation of a sound pulse after the reconnection event. Our results have the prospect of being tested in several quantum fluid experiments and, theoretically, may shed new light on the energy transfer mechanisms in both classical and quantum turbulent fluids.},

The superfluid component is described by the vortex filament method while the normal fluid is governed by a modified Navier--Stokes equation. The superfluid vortex lines and normal fluid components are fully coupled in a self-consistent manner by the friction force, which induces local disturbances in the normal fluid in the vicinity of vortex lines. The main focus of this work is the numerical scheme for distributing the friction force to the mesh points where the normal fluid is defined (stemming from recent advances in the study of the interaction between a classical viscous fluid and small active particles) and for evaluating the velocity of the normal fluid on the Lagrangian discretisation points along the vortex lines. In particular, we show that if this numerical scheme is not careful enough, spurious results may occur. The new scheme which we propose to overcome these difficulties is based on physical principles. Finally, we apply the new method to the problem of the motion of a superfluid vortex ring in a stationary normal fluid and in a turbulent normal fluid.},

Universal aspects of the reconnection process are investigated by considering different initial vortex configurations and making use of a recently developed tracking algorithm to reconstruct the vortex filaments. We show that during a reconnection event the vortex lines approach and separate always according to the time scaling {$\delta\sim$}t1/2 with prefactors that depend on the vortex configuration. We also investigate the behavior of curvature and torsion close to the reconnection point, demonstrating analytically that the curvature can exhibit a self-similar behavior that might be broken by the development of shocklike structures in the torsion.},

Lett. 125, 164501 (2020)] reported the evidence that vortex reconnections in quantum fluids follow an irreversible dynamics, namely, vortices separate faster than they approach; such time asymmetry is explained by using simple conservation arguments. In this work we develop further these theoretical considerations and provide a detailed study of the vortex reconnection process for all the possible geometrical configurations of the order parameter (superfluid) wave function. By matching the theoretical description of incompressible vortex filaments and the linear theory describing locally vortex reconnections, we determine quantitatively the linear momentum and energy exchanges between the incompressible (vortices) and the compressible (density waves) degrees of freedom of the superfluid. We show theoretically and corroborate numerically, why a unidirectional density pulse must be generated after the reconnection process and why only certain reconnecting angles, related to the rates of approach and separations, are allowed. Finally, some aspects concerning the conservation of center-line helicity during the reconnection process are discussed.},

    abstract = "{The dynamics of quantized vortices in superfluids has received increased attention recently because of novel techniques developed to visualize them directly. One of these techniques [G. P. Bewley et al., Nature 441, 588 (2006)] visualized quantized vortices and their reconnections in superfluid flows of 4He by using solid hydrogen tracers of micron-size or larger. The present work improves upon the previous technique by using substantially smaller particles created by injecting atmospheric air diluted in helium gas. These smaller particles are detectable thanks to the higher index of refraction of nitrogen compared to hydrogen and thanks to an improved visualization setup. The optical counting estimate, which agrees with terminal velocity estimates, suggests that the tracer diameter is typically 400 ± 200 nm and could be as small as 200 nm; being smaller, but not so small as to be influenced by thermal motion, the particles get trapped on the vortices faster, perturb the vortices less, possess smaller Stokes drag, and stay trapped on fast-moving vortices, as also on vortices generated closer to the superfluid transition temperature. Unlike the past, the ability to create particles in the superfluid state directly (instead of creating them above the λ-point and cooling the fluid subsequently), ensures greater temperature stability for longer periods, and enables the tracking of long and isolated vortices. These advantages have also led to the direct visualization of Kelvin waves. The use of other seed gases could lead to the visualization of even smaller tracers for quantized vortices. We discuss the visualization setup and provide suggestions for further improvement.}",
